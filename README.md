# TempSwitch 
### Celcius To Fahrenheit Converter

- This program is a lightweight Python-based temperature conversion utility that converts temperature values from degrees Celsius (°C) to degrees Fahrenheit (°F). It applies the standard linear transformation formula used in thermodynamics and meteorology:

°F=(°C×9/5)+32

The program is designed for accuracy, simplicity, and ease of integration into larger applications or scripts.

This website is part of a broader initiative titled Ethan LLM Works, a series of projects wherein I transform my original coding programs into interactive HTML-based simulations and calculators using advanced prompt engineering workflows.

These projects can be thought of as a creative extension of my previous works, leveraging large language models and AI-based development toolsets to transform concepts and projects into a web-based format. While the original Python/Java/C++ scripts listed in the repositories are my own, I do not claim any originality or ownership of the websites generated from this initiative. This endeavor is solely to demonstrate my application of AI-based technologies, in which I'm involved in concepts regarding prompt engineering, system structuring, testing, and refinement before eventual site deployment.

Ethan LLM Works is a self-directed, independent passion I pursue in free time as a means of exploring LLM product development, rapid prototyping, and interactive computational design in a highly intuitive and engaging format.
